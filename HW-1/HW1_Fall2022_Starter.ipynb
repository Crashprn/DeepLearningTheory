You want to learn k closest neighbors of any given point and assign to that point the most common class \n","(by majority vote) found in the neighborhood as defined by the closest k points.

However, the question is how do we know what the value of \"k\" should be? The answer is that we do not know this \n","apriori. Hence we have to do a grid search on a set of candidate values of \"k\" and use a resampling method such as \n","5 fold CV or LOOCV (leave-one-out-of cross validation) to get a more robust answer\n","\n","iii. In the context of this problem, we consider both cases i.e. (a) 5 fold CV, (b) LOOCV\n","\n","(a) 5 fold CV - We create the 5 folds. We make 5 passes through the data. In each pass, we reserve \n","one fold and use the other 4 folds to predict the classes of the held out fold. We then use the prediction and the \n","true label to compute an accuracy for that pass. At the end of 5 passes, we average out the accuracy and\n","report is as the 5 fold cross validated accuracy\n","\n","(b) LOOCV - Same as above. Just that instead of 5 passes we have to make \"n\" (Size of the dataset) passes because in\n","each pass we predict a [1 (true label matches predicted), 0(otherwise)] score for just one data point that is held out\n","using the others to predict the class of the held out datapoint. In the end we count the number of 1's and divide by n \n","to get the accuracy.\n","\n","'''"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":97,"status":"ok","timestamp":1661993024832,"user":{"displayName":"haozhe chen","userId":"12884296704885940675"},"user_tz":360},"id":"SxsEU7YJ4ZGh"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define X, y\n","X = df[['A', 'P', 'C', 'L_Kern','W_Kern', 'Asy_Coeff','L_Kern_Grv']]\n","y = df['Y']\n","\n","# import packages\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","\n","'''        \n","Step - build a knn model with k = 1, 5, 10, 15, use 5-fold cv\n","'''\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jBFtDy-QaWDu"},"outputs":[],"source":["'''        \n","Step - build a knn model with k = 1, 5, 10, 15, use LOOCV\n","'''"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"I5QuvkojaW1L"},"outputs":[],"source":["'''\n","Step\n","Line plot of errors for each k for 5 fold CV\n","Line plot of errors for each k for LOOCV\n","\n","Remark:\n","\n","Make sure the plot is properly labeled.\n","\n","'''"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"V11r7FH_4ZLL"},"outputs":[],"source":["'''\n","Problem 6.2 -- \n","\n","Apply logistic regression, SVM, and random forest.
